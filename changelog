v0.1 2013 Sep 20

This started as a little toy program to implement color quantization.  But then
I looked to see what else was published in Go along these lines and didn't find
much.  To add something of interest, I implemented a second algorithm and added
an interface.  That's about all that is in v0.1 here.  It's far from general
utility.  It needs things like dithering, subsampling, optimization for common
image types, and test code.
